# Lessons Learned

## Always follow TODO.md workflow
**Mistake**: Jumped straight to implementation without writing plan to `docs/TODO.md` first.
**Rule**: For any non-trivial task (3+ steps), write the plan to `docs/TODO.md` with checkable items BEFORE writing any code. Get agreement, then implement while tracking progress.
